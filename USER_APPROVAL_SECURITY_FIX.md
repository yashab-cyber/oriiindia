# User Approval System Security Fix

## Issue Description
**Problem**: New registered users were appearing on the public people page and admin dashboard user management before being approved by administrators.

**Security Impact**: This allowed unapproved users to have public visibility before manual approval, defeating the purpose of the approval system.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Public Users Endpoint** (`/api/users`): Only filtered by `isActive: true` but didn't check approval status
2. **Admin Users Endpoint** (`/admin/users`): Showed all users regardless of approval status in the main user list
3. **User Profile Endpoint** (`/api/users/:id`): Only checked if user was active, not if approved

## Fix Implementation

### Backend Changes

#### 1. Updated Public Users Controller (`/backend/controllers/userController.js`)
```javascript
// Before: Only checked active status
const query = { isActive: true };

// After: Check active AND approved status
const query = { 
  isActive: true,
  isApproved: true,
  approvalStatus: 'approved'
};
```

#### 2. Updated User Profile Access (`/backend/controllers/userController.js`)
```javascript
// Before: Only checked active status
if (!user || !user.isActive) {

// After: Check active AND approved status
if (!user || !user.isActive || !user.isApproved || user.approvalStatus !== 'approved') {
```

#### 3. Updated Admin Users Endpoint (`/backend/routes/admin.js`)
```javascript
// Before: No approval filtering
let query = {};

// After: Only show approved users in main admin list
let query = {
  isApproved: true,
  approvalStatus: 'approved'
};
```

### Frontend Impact
- **People Page** (`/frontend/src/app/people/page.tsx`): Now only displays approved users
- **Admin Dashboard** (`/frontend/src/app/admin/users/page.tsx`): Main "All Users" tab shows only approved users
- **Admin Pending Tab**: Continues to show pending users for approval workflow

## Testing Results

### Test Scenarios Verified ✅
1. **Public Visibility**: Pending users hidden from public people page
2. **Admin User List**: Pending users hidden from main admin user management
3. **Pending Queue**: Pending users correctly appear in admin pending approvals tab
4. **Profile Access**: Individual user profiles inaccessible until approved

### Test Output
```
🔍 Test 1: Checking public users endpoint...
✅ PASS: Test user correctly hidden from public endpoint
📊 Public users count: 10

🔍 Test 2: Checking admin users endpoint...  
✅ PASS: Test user correctly hidden from admin users list
📊 Admin approved users count: 10

🔍 Test 3: Checking admin pending users endpoint...
✅ PASS: Test user correctly appears in pending users list
📊 Pending users count: 1 (test user only)
```

## Security Improvements

### Before Fix
- ❌ New registrations immediately visible to public
- ❌ Unapproved users appeared in admin user list
- ❌ User profiles accessible before approval
- ❌ Approval system easily bypassed

### After Fix  
- ✅ New registrations hidden until approved
- ✅ Clean separation between approved and pending users
- ✅ User profiles require approval for access
- ✅ Robust approval workflow enforcement

## Current User Status
- **Total Users**: 10
- **Approved Users**: 10 (all existing users approved)
- **Pending Users**: 0 (all historical users have been approved)
- **Rejected Users**: 0

## Admin Workflow
1. **User Registration**: User submits registration → Status: Pending
2. **Admin Review**: Admin sees user in "Pending Approvals" tab
3. **Approval/Rejection**: Admin approves or rejects with reason
4. **Public Visibility**: Only approved users appear in public areas

## Files Modified
- `/backend/controllers/userController.js` - Public user filtering
- `/backend/routes/admin.js` - Admin user filtering  
- Test scripts created for verification

## Conclusion
The user approval system now properly enforces security by:
- Hiding pending registrations from public view
- Maintaining clean admin user management
- Providing proper approval workflow through dedicated pending tab
- Ensuring only approved users have public profiles

The fix maintains the existing admin approval workflow while closing the security gap that allowed unapproved users to be publicly visible.
